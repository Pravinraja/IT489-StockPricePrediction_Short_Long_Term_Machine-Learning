<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Explained</h2>
<p>A very good recurrent neural network method to use for time-series forecasting to predict the future sequence pattern from using historical data of stock prices. LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they're able to store past information.<br />(RNNs) come into play because traditional neural networks can not really predict from history. For example, think of what you want to classify what kind of event is happening at every point in a movie or a game. It&rsquo;s pretty unclear how a traditional neural network could use its reasoning about previous events in the film or game to inform later ones. Recurrent neural networks address this issue. They are networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist as time keeps going, so they can predict what happens in the future.</p>
